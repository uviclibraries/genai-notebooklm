# Getting Started with NotebookLM’s _Notebook Guide_
<img src="images/5-notebooklm-logo.png" style="float:right;width:280px;padding:10px;" alt="NotebookLM Logo">

> **Quick idea:** In this activity you’ll turn a small pile of readings, notes, or webpages into a **personal AI assistant** that actually knows your stuff and cites it back to you.

## Learning goals

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Build a **notebook** with multiple sources (PDFs, Docs, webpages, etc.).
- Use **Notebook Guide / Studio tools** (Report, Audio, Flashcards, Quiz) on your own material.
- Judge whether NotebookLM’s output is **accurate, biased, or hallucinating** by checking against the originals.

---

## Step 1 – Create your first notebook

1. Open [notebooklm.google](https://notebooklm.google/) and sign in.  
2. Click **New notebook**.  
3. Give it a **purposeful title**, e.g.:
   - “CIVE 5xx – Literature Review”
   - “Thesis – Methodology Sources”
   - “Workshop Demo – NotebookLM”

4. Add **at least 2–3 sources**:
   - Click **Add source** → upload a PDF or select a Google Doc/Slide/Sheet.
   - Paste a URL to a publicly accessible article or page.
   - (Optional) Add a YouTube link or audio file.

> **Pro tip:** Mix formats in one notebook (PDF + web page + slides). NotebookLM is good at weaving them together, but you’ll want to know which source each idea came from.

---

## Step 2 – Explore the source summaries

1. In the **left panel**, click on a **single source** (one PDF, one webpage).  
2. Look at the **source summary** that NotebookLM generates:
   - Main summary paragraph(s),
   - Key topics,
   - People/places/terms it highlights.

3. Scroll a bit through the original document and **spot-check the summary**:
   - Does it capture the main topic correctly?
   - Did it miss anything crucial?
   - Is any claim clearly wrong?

> **Mini reflection:**  
> Write down 2–3 claims from the summary that you want to double-check later. You’ll use these when we talk about verification.

---

## Step 3 – Use Notebook Guide: Reports & Study Guides

Now we use the **Notebook Guide / Studio** panel to generate more structured outputs.

1. Open the **Notebook Guide / Studio** panel (exact name may vary by UI version).  
2. Choose a template like:
   - **Briefing Doc / Report**
   - **Study Guide**
   - **FAQ / Q&A**

3. Set a clear **audience and purpose**, e.g.:
   - “Write a 300–400 word briefing for my supervisor who has not read these papers.”
   - “Create a study guide for a midterm exam, including key terms and short explanations.”

4. Select which sources to include:
   - Start with **1–2 sources**, not the entire notebook.

5. Generate the output and skim:
   - Are key ideas represented?
   - Are there sections that look too generic or “AI-ish”?

> **Check the sources:**  
> Pick one paragraph from the report. Ask the chat:  
> “Show the exact quotes and page numbers that support this paragraph.”  
> Compare answer vs. document. Mark any mismatch.

## Step 4 – Audio Overview (podcast-style summary)

Audio Overviews turn your notebook into a short, conversational explanation you can listen to.

1. In the **Notebook Guide / Studio** area, look for **Audio Overview**.  
2. Choose:
   - 1–3 sources (keep it small at first),
   - A target **duration** if available (e.g., 5–10 minutes),
   - A style, if offered (formal, conversational, etc.).

3. Generate the overview and listen for a few minutes:
   - Does it capture the core ideas?
   - Are the hosts oversimplifying anything important?
   - Would you trust this to explain your project to a busy colleague?

> **Variation:**  
> Ask NotebookLM: “Regenerate this Audio Overview for a **non-expert audience** (e.g., high-school student or new team member).” Compare what changes.

---

## Step 5 – Flashcards & Quizzes

Now we switch to **active recall** tools.

1. Open the **Flashcards / Quiz** section (this may be under “Study” or “Notebook Guide” depending on the UI).  
2. Choose:
   - The **topic** (e.g., “key terms from Document 1”),  
   - The **difficulty** (easy, medium, hard),  
   - The number of cards/questions (start with 5–10).

3. Generate flashcards:
   - Test yourself: can you answer before flipping the card?
   - Edit any card that feels vague or misleading.

4. Generate a quiz:
   - Multiple choice or short-answer questions based on your sources.
   - After each question, show the explanation and source citation.

> **Goal:**  
> Don’t just memorize the AI’s answer. Use the flashcards/quiz to identify **which parts of the original documents you still don’t understand**.

---

## Step 6 – Build your own workflow

Take 5–10 minutes to design a **repeatable workflow** you could actually use after this workshop. For example:

- **Thesis / dissertation mode**
  - One notebook per chapter.
  - Sources: key articles + your own draft.
  - Tools: Reports (for argument structure), Study Guides (for exams), Audio Overview (for long walks).

- **Teaching / course prep mode**
  - One notebook per course or module.
  - Sources: readings, slide decks, assignment briefs.
  - Tools: Reports (lecture outlines), FAQs (student Q&A), Slide Decks (draft lecture slides).

- **Survey / feedback analysis mode**
  - One notebook per survey/project.
  - Sources: export of free-text responses.
  - Tools: Reports (themes), Tables (example quotes), Flashcards (practice discussing findings).

Write your workflow down somewhere you’ll actually see it again.

## Reflection (write briefly)

- What did NotebookLM do best for this topic?  
- Which feature (Report, Audio, Flashcards, Quiz, Audio Overview) helped you most, and why?  
- List one claim you **verified in the source** and how you verified it.  
- How might you adapt this notebook for your **real** work or studies next week?

## Ready for next step?

Next, we’ll go deeper into **summarizing text, audio, and video** with more control over audience, tone, and length.
