# Getting Started with NotebookLM’s _Notebook Guide_
<img src="images/5-notebooklm-logo-2025.png" style="float:right;width:280px;padding:10px;" alt="NotebookLM Logo">

> **What NotebookLM does (2025):**  
> Upload PDFs, websites, YouTube videos, audio files, Google Docs/Slides, and more. NotebookLM builds a **personalized AI expert** based on *your* sources (not the open web), with **inline citations**, **notebook-level tools** (Reports, Study Guide, Timeline, FAQ), and **Studio** (Audio/Video Overviews, Flashcards, Quizzes). Mobile apps (iOS/Android) now support nearly all workflows.

> **Accuracy & Safety**  
> NotebookLM is more reliable when it stays grounded in your sources, but it **can still make errors**. Verify claims (especially statistics, dates, and quotes), and prefer sources with clear authorship and publication details.

If you have questions during the exercise, please ask your instructor.

## Quick Orientation (the UI at a glance)

- **Left: Sources panel** – your uploaded items (PDF, links, Docs). Click to view a source and its **auto-summary**.  
- **Center: Chat** – ask questions, get **inline citations** to exact passages, request transformations, or generate structured outputs.  
- **Right: Studio (Notebook Guide)** – one-click builders: **Audio Overview**, **Reports**, **Study Guide**, **Timeline**, **FAQ**, plus **Flashcards** & **Quizzes**.

> **Tip:** Start with **Notebook Guide** to get a structured “lay of the land,” then use **Chat** for specifics and **Studio** for high-fidelity deliverables.

---

## Log in to NotebookLM (Web + Mobile)

1) Go to **[notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com/){:target="_blank"}**  
2) Click **Try NotebookLM** and sign in with your Google account.  
   - No account? Click **Create account** and follow the steps.  
3) Optional: Install the **NotebookLM** mobile app (iOS/Android). The app now supports **Flashcards, Quizzes,** and full notebook workflows (uploading from device, listening to Audio Overviews on the go, etc.).

> **Privacy note:** Your sources, questions, and responses are used to serve you in your notebook and are **not** used to train general models. Share notebooks only with people who should see your materials.

---

## Create a Notebook & Add Documents

You’ll create a new notebook, then upload a small set of sources so NotebookLM can ground its responses.

1) **Download the three PDFs** (activity dataset):  
   - [Document 1](images/badge-article.pdf){:target="_blank"}  
   - [Document 2](images/badge-article-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}  
   - [Document 3](images/badge-article-3.pdf){:target="_blank"}

2) Click **Create** (top left) to start a notebook.  
   <img src="images/2025-nblm-create.png" style="width:680px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Create a new notebook"><br>

3) **Upload your PDFs** using **Choose file** (center pane).  
   <img src="images/2025-nblm-upload.png" style="width:820px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Upload sources"><br>

4) Confirm each source appears in the **Sources** panel (left). Click a source to view its **auto-summary** at the top.

> **Best practice:** Use clean, accessible PDFs (selectable text, not just images). If you must use scans, ensure OCR is embedded or add a text transcript.

## Explore the Notebook Guide (2025 Upgrades)

The **Notebook Guide** (in Studio) gives you one-click overviews of everything in your notebook. These are **grounded** on your uploaded sources.

> **Citations behavior:**  
> - **Chat**: shows inline citations by default.  
> - **Reports** and some Notebook Guide outputs: may summarize without inline citations. For important facts, ask Chat:  
>   *“Cite the exact sentence and page supporting this claim.”*

### 1) Source Summaries (per-document overview)
Click a source (left panel) to see its autogenerated **summary** plus key topics.

<img src="images/2025-nblm-source-summary.png" style="width:750px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Source summary view"><br>

**Why use it:** Quickly gauge a document’s scope before deep-diving.

> **Reflection:** Where is the summary faithful? Where is it vague? Write down *two* claims to verify in the original.

---

### 2) Audio Overview (podcast-style, two hosts)
Generates a **two-speaker audio** that walks through your notebook’s content. You can **Customize** audience, tone, and **length** (Shorter/Default/Longer). An **Interactive mode** lets you “join the conversation” to ask follow-ups.

<img src="images/2025-nblm-audio-overview.png" style="width:620px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Generate Audio Overview"><br>

**Steps**
1. Go to **Studio → Audio Overview**  
2. Click **Customize** → define *Audience*, *Goals*, *Length* → **Generate**  
3. Click **Play**, or **⋮ → Download** for offline listening

**Example customization**  
“**Audience:** university parents worried about job prospects; **Goal:** demystify how digital badges help employers understand student skills; **Tone:** encouraging but realistic.”

> **Reflection:** Where was the explanation strong? What should be shorter/clearer? How might this help non-technical stakeholders?

---

### 3) Reports (briefing documents)
Creates a **sectioned, skimmable report** with headings, bullets, and takeaways from your full source set. Can be generated in multiple languages.

<img src="images/2025-nblm-reports.png" style="width:460px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Reports button"><br>

> **Reflection:** Is the structure optimal for your audience (executive vs. student)? Where do you need citations? Ask Chat to attach citations to specific claims.

---

### 4) Study Guide (Q&A, essays, glossary)
Builds:
- Short-answer questions (with answers)  
- Essay prompts (no answers)  
- Glossary of terms (good for quick refreshers)

<img src="images/2025-nblm-study-guide.png" style="width:460px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Study Guide button"><br>

> **Reflection:** Are the questions pitched at the right level? Which glossary entry needs clearer wording or a source quote?

---

### 5) Timeline (chronological synthesis)
Extracts **events/findings** and orders them across all sources.

<img src="images/2025-nblm-timeline.png" style="width:460px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Timeline button"><br>

> **Reflection:** What surprised you about the sequencing? Name one timeline item you’ll confirm directly in the source.

---

### 6) FAQ (document-scoped questions)
Auto-generates an FAQ that helps you find “which source says what” without re-reading every page.

<img src="images/2025-nblm-faq.png" style="width:460px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="FAQ button"><br>

> **Reflection:** Which answer was most actionable? Where would you want a quote and page number?

---

## New & Notable (Studio, 2025 edition)

- **Flashcards** – Convert your notebook into study decks; choose deck size, difficulty, and include definitions/quotes.  
  <img src="images/2025-nblm-flashcards.png" style="width:640px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Flashcards"><br>

- **Quizzes** – Generate auto-graded quizzes; customize length, hints, and language.  
  <img src="images/2025-nblm-quizzes.png" style="width:640px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="Quizzes"><br>

- **Multiple Overviews per notebook** – Create **separate Audio/Video Overviews** for chapters, audiences, or languages. Name them clearly (e.g., `Employer Brief – EN`, `Student Explainer – ES`, `Faculty Deep-Dive – EN (Long)`).

- **Discover mode** – Let NotebookLM propose **relevant web sources** to enrich your notebook. Always **verify credibility** and consider saving offline copies for reproducibility.

- **Custom Personas** – In Chat, set a role/voice (e.g., **“Exam Coach”** or **“Research Mentor”**). This influences how answers are structured.

- **Larger context window** – Handle bigger source sets in a single notebook with greater continuity across long chats and complex reports.

---

## “Do this, not that” (quick quality checklist)

**Do**
- Upload final/authoritative versions (publisher PDFs, DOIs).  
- Ask for **citations**: “Cite the exact sentence and page.”  
- Keep **one idea per prompt**; iterate with follow-ups.  
- Compare outputs: **Audio vs. Report vs. FAQ**.  
- Use **Flashcards/Quizzes** to test retention.

**Avoid**
- Mixing unrelated topics in one notebook.  
- Accepting numeric claims without source quotes.  
- Uploading low-quality scans without OCR.  
- Using one massive prompt for many tasks (split it).

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

**I don’t see citations.**  
Use **Chat**:  
> “Attach inline citations to the following Report section and list the exact quote and page for each claim.”

**Audio Overview is too long/short.**  
Use **Customize → Length** and set Shorter/Default/Longer. Or:  
> “Regenerate as a 6–7 minute overview focusing only on employer-relevant outcomes.”

**Summaries feel generic.**  
Provide **audience + purpose** up front:  
> “Summarize for **provincial policymakers**; focus on budget impacts and credentialing quality controls.”

**Sources conflict.**  
Ask:  
> “Show a side-by-side of conflicting claims with citations, then provide a reconciliation and confidence rating.”

**Mobile parity.**  
Most features work in the app. For long editing (Reports), prefer desktop; for **Flashcards/Quizzes/Audio**, the app is great.

---

## Privacy, Collaboration, and Export

- **Privacy:** Notebooks remain private to you unless you share. Review source sensitivity before inviting collaborators.  
- **Collaboration:** Share notebooks read-only (students) vs. editor (co-instructors). Define roles clearly.  
- **Export:** Download **Audio (MP3)**, **Reports (Markdown/PDF)**, and **Flashcards/Quizzes (CSV or screenshot)** for LMS upload.

---

## Practice Prompts (copy-paste)

**Summarization**
- “Summarize this source in plain English for a first-year student; bold the top three takeaways.”

**Evidence**
- “Provide an evidence table with: Claim | Direct Quote | Citation (page/section) | Confidence.”

**Compare**
- “Compare Source A vs. Source B on methodology, sample size, and bias; end with a bullet ‘So what for educators?’”

**Transform**
- “Rewrite the findings as a 2-minute dean’s briefing, max 180 words, with 3 actionable items.”

**Test**
- “Generate 10 flashcards (term|definition|source quote) and 5 quiz questions (with answers) from these sections.”

---

## Reflection (write briefly)
- What did NotebookLM do best for this topic?  
- Which feature (Report, Audio, Flashcards, Quiz) helped you most, and why?  
- List one claim you verified in the source and how you verified it.  
- What will you change about your prompts or sources next time?
