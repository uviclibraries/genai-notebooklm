## 🎭 Shakespeare Text Analysis Activity (Context & Setup)

### Why Shakespeare?
William Shakespeare’s works (1564–1616) are among the most linguistically rich texts in English—full of **dense metaphor**, **emotional paradox**, and **inverted syntax**. That makes them ideal for stress-testing **NotebookLM** as a reasoning partner: summarizing archaic language, mapping imagery, extracting themes, and generating study aids.

For this workshop we’ll use short excerpts from *The Complete Works of Shakespeare* (Project Gutenberg edition) to:
- Translate poetry into modern English
- Identify tone, imagery, and metaphor
- Generate **Mind Maps**, **Audio/Video Overviews**, **quizzes**, and **flashcards**
- Compare how prompt wording changes the outputs

> Outcome: you’ll see how NotebookLM acts as both a **literary interpreter** and a **teaching assistant**, turning complex text into clear, reusable learning objects.

### Selected Passages (use any 1–3)
**1) *A Lover’s Complaint* (lines 4–19)**  
> “O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies  
> In the small orb of one particular tear! …  
> Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.”

**2) *King Lear* V.3 (Lear’s lament)**  
> “Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,  
> And thou no breath at all? … Look there, look there!”

**3) *Cymbeline* V.5 (Soothsayer’s prophecy)**  
> “The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,  
> Personates thee; and thy lopp’d branches point …”

*Each passage is deliberately tricky (emotional inversion, compact imagery, archaic phrasing), perfect for NotebookLM.*

### Prompts to Try in NotebookLM

| Goal | Example Prompt |
|------|----------------|
| Simplify | “Rewrite this passage in simple modern English.” |
| Analyze | “List all metaphors and explain their literal meaning.” |
| Visualize | “Create a mind map of the imagery and emotions.” |
| Summarize | “Explain the tone and message of this passage in 3 sentences.” |
| Create | “Turn this excerpt into a 2-minute podcast script between two AI hosts.” |
| Test | “Generate five quiz questions about themes and imagery.” |

> 💡 Tip: Have the whole group use the *same* passage and prompt set first; compare how phrasing changes the outputs. Then iterate with new prompts.
