### Prompts to Try in NotebookLM

| Goal | Example Prompt |
|------|----------------|
| Simplify | “Rewrite this passage in simple modern English.” |
| Analyze | “List all metaphors and explain their literal meaning.” |
| Visualize | “Create a mind map of the imagery and emotions.” |
| Summarize | “Explain the tone and message of this passage in 3 sentences.” |
| Create | “Turn this excerpt into a 2-minute podcast script between two AI hosts.” |
| Test | “Generate five quiz questions about themes and imagery.” |

> 💡 Tip: Have the whole group use the *same* passage and prompt set first; compare how phrasing changes the outputs. Then iterate with new prompts.

### Studio: Slide Decks & Infographics

Use these optional activities if you want to push beyond text and audio:

- ** 📊 Slide Deck Draft**  
  - Pick any notebook you’ve created (e.g., the badge articles or your own course/project docs).  
  - Ask NotebookLM to generate a **slide outline** or full draft deck for a 5–10 minute talk.  
  - Copy the outline into Google Slides or PowerPoint and edit:
    - Keep the helpful structure (section order, key points).  
    - Rewrite vague or generic bullets.  
    - Remove any slide that doesn’t serve a clear purpose.

- ** 🧩 Infographic Summary**  
  - Ask NotebookLM to create a **one-page infographic specification**: title, sections, 3–5 key points, and suggested icons/visuals.  
  - Use that specification to design a simple infographic in your preferred tool (Canva, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.).  
  - Optionally, compare two versions: one for **experts** (more detail) and one for **non-specialists** (fewer, clearer points).

> **Pro tip:**  
> When you generate slide decks or infographics, always specify **audience**, **time limit**, and **medium** in your prompt (e.g., “10-minute talk for non-experts using 5–7 slides”). The more specific the context, the more usable the AI-generated structure will be.
