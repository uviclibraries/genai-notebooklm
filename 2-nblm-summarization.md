# Summarizing Text, Audio & Video (2025 Edition)
<img src="images/2025-nblm-source-summary.png" style="float:right;width:420px;padding:10px;border:1px solid #555;" alt="NotebookLM source summary view">

In this module, you’ll use **NotebookLM** to transform your uploaded documents, meeting transcripts, and even videos into audience-ready summaries—and then refine, translate, and output those summaries in multiple formats.

You’ll learn how to:
- Upload different types of sources (PDFs, YouTube links, audio files, slides)
- Summarize with a clear purpose (audience, tone, length)
- Verify summaries with citations and evidence tables
- Generate Audio/Video Overviews from the same content
- Translate or re-frame summaries for different audiences
- Create flashcards and quizzes from key takeaways
- Export and share summaries with stakeholders or students

> **Important:** AI tools can still miss nuances—even when grounded in your sources. Treat output as a highly capable assistant, not an autopilot. Verify critical facts and quotes.

If you need help at any time, please ask the instructor.

## 1) Getting Started: Upload Your Sources
1. Create a new notebook in NotebookLM: click **Create** from the dashboard.
2. Upload the sample sources for this module:
   - [Document 1](images/badge-article.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 2](images/badge-article-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   - [Document 3](images/badge-article-3.pdf){:target="_blank"}
3. Confirm that each document appears under the **Sources** panel (left).
4. Click the first document → read the **auto-generated summary**; ensure the text is legible (no garbled OCR).
5. If a document is mostly images without selectable text, consider uploading a text-based version or a PDF with OCR.

## 2) Summarize With Purpose (Audience • Tone • Length)
Avoid generic summaries. Ask for a targeted, audience-specific outcome.

**Example scenario:** You’re preparing promotional copy for parents about the University Makerspace / Library Digital Scholarship Commons.

**Steps**
- In the **Sources** panel, **de-select** Documents 2 and 3 so only Document 1 is used.
- In **Chat**, ask:
  ```text
  Create a 180–220 word summary for parents explaining how the University Makerspace (Library Digital Scholarship Commons) helps with co-op job searches and post-graduation employment. Use plain language, include three concrete benefits supported by evidence from the document, and include inline citations.
