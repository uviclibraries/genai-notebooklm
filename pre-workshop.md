# Pre-Workshop Activities

## Who this workshop is for

This session is designed for:

- **Students** working on essays, capstones, theses, or portfolios  
- **Instructors and staff** preparing slides, handouts, or course guides  
- **Researchers and professionals** who read long reports and need clear summaries  

You do **not** need to be an AI expert. Basic comfort with web tools and text documents is enough.

## What you’ll do in the workshop

During the live session, you will:

- Build a **NotebookLM notebook** from your own sources (PDFs, Docs, webpages, etc.)  
- Generate **summaries, study guides, and brainstorming prompts** grounded in those sources  
- Explore **Studio tools** such as Audio Overview, Video Overview, Reports, Mind Maps, Flashcards, and Quizzes  
- Practice **verifying** AI-generated content by checking citations against the original documents  

By the end, you should have at least one “real” notebook you can keep using for your studies or work.

## What to bring

To get the most out of the workshop, please bring:

- A **laptop** (recommended for full NotebookLM features)  
- A **Google account** you can sign in with  
- 2–3 documents you can safely upload, such as:  
  - A course reading (PDF)  
  - An assignment brief or project description  
  - A publicly accessible article or webpage  
- (Optional) **Headphones**, if you want to listen to Audio Overviews without disturbing others  

If you don’t have your own documents, sample materials will be provided.

## Pre-Workshop Videos & Activities

This workshop consists of a small amount of instruction followed by **hands-on activities**. To be ready to jump straight into NotebookLM, please:

1. As a researcher it is very important that you carefully review UVic’s guidance on generative AI. Please read: [UVic](https://www.uvic.ca/research/teachers-staff/research-admin/research-policies/ai-guidelines/index.php){:target="_blank"} and [Tri-Agency guidance on the use of AI in research development and review](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/en/research-funding/policies/guidelines-research-data-management/tri-agency-guidance-use-artificial-intelligence-review-development-and-review-research-grant-proposals){:target="_blank"}.  
2. Watch at least one short GenAI overview:
- [Here's Why GPT4All Could Be A Real Game-Changer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRcjdfkADI){:target="_blank"} (3 min)<br>
