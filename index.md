# GenAI: NotebookLM – A Personal Tool for Research & Productivity (_Intermediate_)

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min  
- Introductory presentation: 15 min  
- Active learning time: 60 min

## What is NotebookLM?

NotebookLM is Google’s AI research and study workspace. Instead of chatting with a generic model, you load your own sources (papers, PDFs, Docs, Sheets, web pages, videos, notes), and NotebookLM builds a “thinking partner” that stays grounded in those materials.

You can then ask questions, generate explanations, and create outputs (reports, flashcards, slide decks, infographics, audio/video overviews) that are all based on the content you provided. This makes NotebookLM especially useful for courses, research projects, literature reviews, and complex real-world documents.

---

## What does NotebookLM do?

At a high level, NotebookLM lets you:

- **Organize sources into notebooks** for each course, project, or topic.
- **Chat with an AI that cites your sources**, so you can see exactly where each answer comes from.
- **Run Deep Research** to pull in high-quality web sources and save the structured report back into your notebook.
- **Generate learning tools** like flashcards, quizzes, study guides, and concept summaries.
- **Create teaching and communication assets** such as reports, timelines, infographics, and slide decks.
- **Produce audio and video overviews** that turn long documents into podcast-style discussions or short explainers.

The goal is to reduce the time you spend skimming, copying, and re-formatting information so you can focus on understanding, analysis, and creation.

## About this workshop

This intermediate workshop focuses on using NotebookLM as a **personal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool** for research and productivity. Rather than treating AI as a general chatbot, we show you how to build a targeted assistant that:

- Knows only what you give it (your sources)
- Can explain, summarize, and compare those sources
- Can transform them into slides, reports, and study materials

We will use live examples to show how NotebookLM handles typical academic and professional workflows, including note-taking, synthesizing articles, and preparing presentations.

---

## Learning objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. **Describe the core capabilities of NotebookLM** (source-grounded Q&A, summarization, translation, and document synthesis).
2. **Create and organize a notebook** with multiple sources (PDFs, Docs, web pages, etc.).
3. **Use Notebook Guides / Studio tools** to generate briefing docs, study guides, and short written reports.
4. **Generate and evaluate audio or video overviews**, including how to verify their accuracy against the original sources.
5. **Create presentation assistance** (slide titles, outlines, and speaking notes) for Google Slides or PowerPoint.
6. **Use flashcards and quizzes** to turn your notebook into a study or revision tool.
7. **Summarize qualitative feedback** (e.g., survey responses) into themes, insights, and next-step questions.

## Key NotebookLM features we will explore

### 1. Source-grounded chat

- Creating notebooks for a course, project, or research topic  
- Uploading PDFs, Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, web pages, and YouTube / media transcripts  
- Asking questions and reading answers with inline citations back to the original documents  
- Using the chat to check, compare, and explain complex passages

### 2. Deep Research

- Using NotebookLM’s research panel to discover sources on the web  
- Understanding the difference between fast scans and deeper multi-step research  
- Importing the resulting research report and citations into your notebook  
- Using Deep Research to complement (not replace) traditional database searching

### 3. Studio tools: reports, mind maps, and timelines

- Generating structured **reports** (briefing docs, study guides, FAQs, blog-style summaries)  
- Building **mind maps** and **timelines** to visualize people, events, or key concepts  
- Editing and refining generated content while always checking back against the sources

### 4. Audio and video overviews

- Creating **Audio Overviews** (podcast-style two-host discussions of your sources)  
- Exploring **interactive audio**: pausing, asking follow-up questions, and steering the conversation  
- Generating **Video Overviews** that turn your material into short, narrated explainers  
- Using audio/video as alternative ways to review long or dense material

### 5. Slide decks and infographics

- Using **Slide Decks** to automatically draft multi-slide presentations from your notebook  
- Using **Infographics** to condense key ideas into a single visual summary  
- Exporting and refining AI-generated decks and visuals in your preferred slide tool  
- Discussing strengths, limitations, and responsible use of these artifacts

### 6. Study tools: flashcards and quizzes

- Auto-creating flashcards from lecture notes, readings, or project documents  
- Generating quizzes at different difficulty levels for self-testing  
- Using explanations and citations to deepen understanding (not just memorize answers)  
- Sharing flashcards/quizzes with peers for collaborative study

### 7. Infographics 
  - Generate one-page visual summaries of a reading, project, or process.  
  - Useful for posters, handouts, orientation materials, or quick overviews for community partners.  
  - In the workshop, you will create an infographic from a small set of sources and then critique it for clarity, accuracy, and visual hierarchy.

### 8. Slide Deck
  - Draft a multi-slide presentation (outline, slide titles, bullet points, and speaking notes) directly from your notebook.  
  - You will practice taking an AI-generated deck and **editing it like a human expert**: tightening the narrative, removing fluff, checking every claim against citations, and adapting the tone to your real audience.

We treat these features as **first-draft helpers**, not final products. The focus is on using AI to get from “blank slide” to a structured story faster—while you stay in control of the message and design.

## Responsible and critical use

Throughout the workshop, we will emphasize:

- **Verification** – always checking AI-generated text, slides, and summaries against the original sources.
- **Citation and academic integrity** – using NotebookLM as a reading and thinking partner, not as a ghost-writer.
- **Privacy and data handling** – what kinds of documents are appropriate to upload, and when not to use cloud tools.
- **Bias awareness** – understanding that outputs reflect both your uploaded sources and the underlying model’s limitations.

---

## Who is this workshop for?

This intermediate session is designed for:

- Students working on essays, theses, capstone projects, and literature reviews  
- Instructors preparing lectures, slides, or course materials  
- Researchers and staff who need to summarize reports, policies, or long technical documents  
- Anyone comfortable with basic GenAI tools who wants **deeper, source-grounded workflows**

You do **not** need to be an AI expert; basic familiarity with web tools and text editors is enough.

---

## Before the workshop

To get the most out of the session, please:

- Review the **Pre-Workshop Activities** page in this site for short videos and AI usage guidelines.  
- Bring a laptop (recommended) and, if possible, a PDF or document you regularly work with (e.g., a reading, report, or project document) that you can safely upload to NotebookLM.
