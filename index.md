# GenAI: NotebookLM – A Personal Tool for Research & Productivity (_Intermediate_)

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min  
- Introductory presentation: 15 min  
- Active learning time: 60 min

## What is NotebookLM?

NotebookLM is Google’s AI research and study workspace. Instead of chatting with a generic model, you load your own sources (papers, PDFs, Docs, Sheets, web pages, videos, notes), and NotebookLM builds a “thinking partner” that stays grounded in those materials.

You can then ask questions, generate explanations, and create outputs (reports, flashcards, slide decks, infographics, audio/video overviews) that are all based on the content you provided. This makes NotebookLM especially useful for courses, research projects, literature reviews, and complex real-world documents.

## What does NotebookLM do?

At a high level, NotebookLM lets you:

- **Create notebooks** for individual courses, projects, or topics.
- **Automatically cites sources**, so you can see exactly where each answer comes from in the documents you've uploaded to NotebookLM.
- **Run Deep Research** to optionally pull in high-quality web sources and save the structured report back into your notebook.
- **Generate learning tools** like flashcards, quizzes, study guides, and concept summaries.
- **Create teaching and communication assets** such as reports, timelines, infographics, and slide decks.
- **Produce audio and video overviews** that turn long documents into podcast-style discussions or short explainers.

The goal is to reduce the time you spend skimming, copying, and re-formatting information so you can focus on understanding, analysis, and creation.

## About this workshop

This intermediate workshop focuses on using NotebookLM as a **personal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool** for research and productivity. Rather than treating AI as a general chatbot, we show you how to build a targeted assistant that:

- Knows only what you give it (your sources)
- Can explain, summarize, and compare those sources
- Can transform them into slides, reports, and study materials

We will use live examples to show how NotebookLM handles typical academic and professional workflows, including note-taking, synthesizing articles, and preparing presentations.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. **Describe the core capabilities of NotebookLM** (source-grounded Q&A, summarization, translation, and document synthesis).
2. **Create and organize a notebook** with multiple sources (PDFs, Docs, web pages, etc.).
3. **Use Notebook Guides / Studio tools** to generate briefing docs, study guides, and short written reports.
4. **Generate and evaluate audio or video overviews**, including how to verify their accuracy against the original sources.
5. **Create presentation assistance** (slide titles, outlines, and speaking notes) for Google Slides or PowerPoint.
6. **Use flashcards and quizzes** to turn your notebook into a study or revision tool.
7. **Summarize qualitative feedback** (e.g., survey responses) into themes, insights, and next-step questions.

## Responsible and critical use

Throughout the workshop, we will emphasize:

- **Verification** – always checking AI-generated text, slides, and summaries against the original sources.
- **Citation and academic integrity** – using NotebookLM as a reading and thinking partner, not as a ghost-writer.
- **Privacy and data handling** – what kinds of documents are appropriate to upload, and when not to use cloud tools.
- **Bias awareness** – understanding that outputs reflect both your uploaded sources and the underlying model’s limitations.

## Who is this workshop for?

This intermediate session is designed for:

- Students working on essays, theses, capstone projects, and literature reviews  
- Instructors preparing lectures, slides, or course materials  
- Researchers and staff who need to summarize reports, policies, or long technical documents  
- Anyone comfortable with basic GenAI tools who wants **deeper, source-grounded workflows**

You do **not** need to be an AI expert; basic familiarity with web tools and text editors is enough.

---

## Before the workshop

To get the most out of the session, please:

- Review the **Pre-Workshop Activities** page in this site for short videos and AI usage guidelines.  
- Bring a laptop (recommended) and, if possible, a PDF or document you regularly work with (e.g., a reading, report, or project document) that you can safely upload to NotebookLM.
