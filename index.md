# GenAI: NotebookLM a Personal RAG Tool for Research & Productivity (_Intermediate_)

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min 
- Introductory presentation: 15 min
- Active learning time: 60 min

## About the workshop 
- This workshop focuses on using NoteBookLM, a personal Generative AI (GenAI) tool, that becomes an expert on the specific documents you provide.
- Crucially, NoteBookLM's functionality is directly dependent on the documents you upload. It uses these documents as its training data.
- Participants will engage in hands-on activities to explore GenAI tool usage and learn how to evaluate output for accuracy and potential biases, based on the uploaded documents.
- The workshop will also promote informed and responsible use of cloud-based GenAI.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Describe the core capabilities of NotebookLM (text generation, summarization, translation, Q&A).
2. Use the **Notebook guide** to quickly create briefing docs and a two-host audio summary.
3. Create lecture/meeting transcription summaries tailored to audience and purpose.
4. Produce research summaries with citations; verify facts/claims against sources.
5. Generate presentation assistance (script + slide titles for Google Slides/PowerPoint).
6. Perform ideation/brainstorming: identify gaps and form research questions.
7. Summarize short-answer survey feedback to surface key issues.
8. Apply responsible-use checks (bias/hallucination mitigation with grounded prompts).
9. Share artifacts (export, screenshots) for portfolios or class submissions.
